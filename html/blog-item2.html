                  “The time I felt the most pride in being the person that I am was when I came out to the world as part of the LGBTIQA+ community. It was the feeling of having both young children and the elders of my community look to me as someone who decided to be true to herself. I felt pride in my coming out as it was something I decided to do on my own terms and timing. Although there was a level of fear with living my truth – because of the perspective I thought my immediate community would have – I still stood [by] who I am as a person. And, all in all, the impact of doing that brought me a wider community.”
